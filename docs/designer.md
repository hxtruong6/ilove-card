### Product Concept Overview

**Unique Value Proposition (UVP):**  
"A festive, interactive digital platform where users collaboratively decorate personalized trees with heartfelt messages, transforming celebrations into shared, watercolor-inspired visual memories."

**Key Differentiators:**

- **Visual Storytelling**: Messages are integrated into a watercolor-painted tree as ornaments or leaves.
- **Interactivity**: Friends actively contribute to a user’s tree, fostering engagement.
- **Personalization**: Customizable trees with a shareable, artistic flair in a watercolor style.

**Art Direction:**  
The design should leverage a watercolor art style—soft, organic brushstrokes, gentle gradients, and a hand-painted aesthetic—to evoke warmth and creativity. Colors should reflect seasonal themes (e.g., greens and reds for Christmas, oranges for Halloween) while maintaining a cohesive, artistic look.
